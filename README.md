After entering a name in the form, the person should be greeted with his/hear name
reversed, so e.g. entering "Dino" should result in "Hello Onid", "Stefan" should
result in "Hello Nafets", etc..

For reversing the name, probably existing builtin methods like .reverse() might
not be used. The reversed name should start with an uppercase letter as well.

In addition, any hints for improving the given code is highly appreciated.
